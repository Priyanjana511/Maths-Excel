 1. Plotting and fitting of Binomial distribution and graphical representation of probabilities.
# Binomial Distribution
 The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution. It describes the outcome of binary scenarios, e.g. toss of a coin.

  Mean(µ=np)
 Variance(σ²=npq) 
Implementation in Excel:
 =BINOM.DIST(number_s, trials, probability_s, cumulative)
 Where: 
number_s: number of successes. 
trials: total number of trials. 
probability_s: probability of success on each trial. cumulative: TRUE
 returns the cumulative probability; FALSE returns the exact probability
